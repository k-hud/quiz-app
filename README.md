# quiz-app

Hi! This is my Quiz App. The first major assignment for my Full Stack Developer course at Thinkful.

You can play the Quiz App here: https://kylemhudson.github.io/quiz-app/

FEATURES

Here are some of the features I worked into the app:

- When you answer a question, we turn off the radio buttons. No going back and changing your mind!
- The questions will be presented at random. Dont try and remember the position of a right answer, they change every time!
- Let's shut off the Submit button while we're at it so we don't resubmit.
- While you're deciding on a question, we'll have a little Rascal show you his displeasure.
- When you answer, we'll randomize a set of GIFs and show related reactions based on if you got it right or not.
- You'll get a reaction, we'll tell you what the right answer was, and and tell you the question that's coming up.
- No skipping! Dont try and not answer, you'll get an alert.
- When you're all done with your 10 questions, we'll tally the answers, give you your score, and present you with a final nice GIF.

ENJOY!


The requirements for the app are:

User experience requirements
* The starting screen should have a button that users can click to start the quiz.
* Users should be prompted through a series of at least 5 multiple choice questions that they can answer.
* Users should be asked questions 1 after the other.
* Users should only be prompted with 1 question at a time.
* Users should not be able to skip questions.
* Users should also be able to see which question they're on (for instance, "7 out of 10") and their current score ("5 correct, 2 incorrect").
* Upon submitting an answer, users should:
* receive textual feedback about their answer. If they were incorrect, they should be told the correct answer.
* be moved onto the next question (or interact with an element to move on).
* Users should be shown their overall score at the end of the quiz. In other words, how many questions they got right out of the total questions asked.
* Users should be able to start a new quiz.

Technical requirements
Your quiz app must:
* Render answer choices in a <form>.
* Use semantic HTML, along with CSS and jQuery.
* Follow a11y best practices.
* Refer back to the lessons on accessibility and forms for help.
* Use responsive design and be usable in 320px-wide viewports.
* Refer to this checklist for help.
* Be fully usable by keyboard (which will be easy enough if you start with a form).
